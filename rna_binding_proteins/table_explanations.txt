2) Description of tables

a. proteins
id - unique id number
annotID - annotation ID (Ensembl/Flybase/Wormbase/etc)
createDate - date the protein was added to the database
updateDate - last curation date for the protein
geneName - official (HGNC/MGI/Flybase) gene symbol
geneDesc - gene description
species - species name in binomial nomenclature, eg "Homo sapiens"
taxID - NCBI taxonomy ID for the species
domains - string describing the domains (see below for abbreviations)
flag - if 1, protein has been flagged and will not appear on the site. Don't use these proteins in
	your analyses!
flagNote - reason for flag (eg: pseudogene, non RNA-binding, etc)
aliases - alternative gene names
PDBIDs - Protein Data Bank ID(s) of structures containing RNA-bound protein
UniProtIDs - UniProt ID(s) for the gene

b. experiments
id - unique id number
pmID - PubMed ID for the experiment
exptype - type of experiment
notes - notes for this experiment
sequence_motif - motifs reported (possibly multiple, separated by ; )
SELEX_file - raw sequences extracted from publications
aligned_SELEX_file - SELEX sequences aligned as in publication,
	with the reported motif enclosed in brackets
aligned_motif_file - motif sequences as reported in the publication, used to construct PFMs
logo_file - filename for logo
PWM_file - filename for PWM
PFM_file - filename for PFM
invivo_notes - for in vivo (RIP-chip/seq/etc), where to find the data
	(may be an NCBI GEO accession number)
invivo_file - file name with the sequences bound in vivo
secondary_structure - 1 if the paper reported a secondary structure for the RNA sequence
flag - if 1, experiment has been flagged and will not appear on the site. Don't use these
	experiments in your analyses!
flagNote - reason for flag

c. protExp
id - unique id number
protID - id number for the protein
expID - id number for the experiment
homolog - 1 if the experiment was performed on a non-human/mouse/fly/worm species
